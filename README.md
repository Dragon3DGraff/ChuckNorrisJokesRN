# ChuckNorrisJokesRN

This is test task made by me for junior position. This is remake of [ChuckNorrisJokes](https://github.com/Dragon3DGraff/ChuckNorrisJokes "ChuckNorrisJokes") using React Native

You can test it [here](https://snack.expo.io/@dragon3dgraff/chucknorrisjokesrn "snack.expo.io")

## Task
- There is Api who knows how to receive jokes from Chuck Norris - https://api.chucknorris.io/
- It is necessary to make an interface that would receive one joke by pressing a button and display it on the screen
- You need to create a button that shows a new joke every 3 seconds, and if you press it again, the display of jokes should stop.
- You also need to create a button that adds a joke to the list of favorite jokes and if you press it again it will remove it from the list and when you reload the page, they should be saved. (use localStorage)
- You need to create a button that will go to the list of favorite jokes and from there you can delete any joke
- A maximum of 10 favorite jokes can be displayed, after that when a new joke is added, the very first one is deleted, and a new one is added to the end of the list.
- You also need to create a button that clears the list of favorite jokes.
